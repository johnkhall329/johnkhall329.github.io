        <p>
          This past summer I had the opportunity to apply my knowledge of computer vision and robotic systems as 
          a Software Engineering Intern at <a href="https://www.par.com/">PAR Systems</a> in Shoreview, MN. 
          I am greatful to be continuing to work part-time for PAR while at school. I am a part of a team of eight
          developing software for R&D applications using Agile methodologies. Over the course of the summer, I was able to create programs to control Fanuc robots and utilize RGB-D
          cameras for 3D vision. I greatly improved my Python skills while developing in Linux environments and had the opportunity to learn basic JavaScript
          for front-end applications.

          <p>
            This year I am lucky to be a part of Professor Giovanni Pittiglio's <a href="https://future-lab.wpi.edu/">FuTURE Lab</a> at WPI. 
            This semester I am working in partnership with a medical device company to improve the vision capabilities of endoscopy. I am working on the project individually,
            but I have collaborated with other researchers in the lab along with our corporate partners to develop possibly patentable technology.

          <p>
            Over the summers of 2023 and 2024, I worked in the operations and manufacturing group at Trane Technologies in St. Paul, MN. During those two summers,
            I helped introduce robotic and vision systems into the manufacturing of PCBs on-site. I had a continuing project using a hobby robot and simple camera
            to prototype and research new applications. I learned OpenCV during this project to identify and locate different PCBs and surface mount components.
            During my first summer, I researched and selected an automated thermal paste dispenser that reduced greatly reduced material costs and increased
            overall line productivity.
