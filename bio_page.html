          <p>
            I'm originally from St. Paul, MN and am a recenct graduate from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) with my B.S.
            in Robotics Engineering with a minor in Mechanical Engineering. I'm continuing at WPI for my M.S. in Robotics Engineering and am 
            expected to graduate May of 2026. My main interests relate to environmental and medical robotics and I've been fortunate to have project 
            expereience in both fields. I enjoy exploring robot perception where I can use cameras and other sensors to interpret the world around us.

            Outside of work and school, you will often times find me playing ultimate frisbee, hiking, and doing photograpy. I just recently bought
            a film camera and have been enjoying experimenting with that.
